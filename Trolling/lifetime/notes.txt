Originally the ANSI escape codes specified only 8 colors for foreground (the text) 
from 30 to 37: black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan and white. 
Same colors can be used for the terminal background but these are defined as 
the numbers from 40 to 47.

\x1b[33m yellow
\x1b[34m blue
\x1b[35m magenta
\x1b[36m Cyan

\x1b[1m is used to make the text bold.

\x1b[0m is used to reset the text attributes to the default.
