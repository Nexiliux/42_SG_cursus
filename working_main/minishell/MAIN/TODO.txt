14/8/24 Goal:
1. Try to allow syscalls to take in arguments (e.g "cd minishell_objs", where 'minishell_objs'
is the argument for cd). DONE

2. Handle â€™ (single quote) which should prevent the shell from interpreting the meta-
characters in the quoted sequence. Specifically for ECHO first, I assume this is for other
commands aswell.
- I don't really understand this yet
-- I got lazy heheh time to sleep

3. Look into redirections
