10/9/24 Now reconvened with Jeremy, I'll be working on echo, pwd, env & exit.
1. work on: 
	1.1 echo.c and what echo -n is
		Since we haven't handle quotes and dquotes yet, this func will only take in
		the string, without considering for quotes etc as if the program has already
		handled and trimmed off everything; echo will only print things to output
		indiscriminately.

		Nvm, this echo will take in two arguments, whether -n was used or not. This
		will allow us to dynamically use future functions to split up whether echo
		has a -n or not BEFORE using the echo function.
		For now, I will implement this inside the echo.c itself.
	1.2 pwd.c
	1.3 env.c
	1.4 exit.c


14/8/24 Goal:
1. Try to allow syscalls to take in arguments (e.g "cd minishell_objs", where 'minishell_objs'
is the argument for cd). DONE

2. Handle â€™ (single quote) which should prevent the shell from interpreting the meta-
characters in the quoted sequence. Specifically for ECHO first, I assume this is for other
commands aswell.
- I don't really understand this yet
-- I got lazy heheh time to sleep

3. Look into redirections
